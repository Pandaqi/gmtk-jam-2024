# Stacked Multiverse

There are multiple randomly generated universes layered on top of each other. (Probably just a simple square grid, or a side-view of planets and stars in space.)

They all have different rules and different objectives. 

For example:
* In universe/dimension A, it's all about fighting and you must destroy the other units.
* In dimension B, it's about exploring and you must simply visit all possible planets.
* In dimension C, it's about money and you must simply be richer than anyone else.

There are obviously ways to transfer resources between the dimensions.

You win if you manage to be the majority presence ( = "conquer") all the dimensions (or the majority of the dimensions).

Within each dimension, you can move around, click on things. With scroll wheel/another key you can shift, like moving along the Z-axis into another dimension.

@IDEA: You can also **zoom in?** Normally, you can only see the final actions or superficial stuff about the planet/enemy. But you can _zoom in_ to get more detail about their resources, their intentions => zooming in takes time and perhaps money, but it will give you a much better clue about how to strategize.


COMBINE WITH THIS IDEA:

* It's about growing your empire and conquering the universe. But every single unit is bound to a different _key_. (
* And so are _locations_ or any other instructions you might want to give.) 
* So as it grows, you'll really struggle to make the right things move to the right other things.

This would mean ALL ACTIONS in this game are movement: "Select Unit > Select Destination" (which is nice and simple)

The main mechanic is then to be able to _group_ those units over time.

RELATED IDEA: A local multiplayer game that constantly adds more and more players, asking you to call up other people to join (or try to do it all yourself)
