# Of Dwarves and Giants

Puzzle game.


You have several different characters of different sizes. The puzzle grid itself is subdivided lots of times (4?), creating "half-movements" for certain characters and such, creating openings only some of them fit through.

You basically get a Sokoban/sliding puzzle where pieces are _different sizes_, with some extra powers/special rules/spice.

(Maybe there are multiple pieces of one size; pressing their specific button/moving one will _move them all_, if possible.)

(The other more obvious idea is a shrink-ray/growth-ray puzzle, or shink-grow your platformer, but those will probably be done by 1000 others.)
