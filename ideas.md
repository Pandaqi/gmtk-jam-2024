## From Discord

I have an idea that's free to anybody who wants to pick it up since I don't think I have the time or skills to finish it in time.  Dragons of vastly different sizes swim/fly around, you shoot them with arrows and their scales (haha, "scales") fall off, where the scales fall they become terrain features of different sizes (islands in the ocean or the like), then you need a system that makes it matter what the terrain ends up looking like.

The idea of the jam reminds me of an old Sega game called Rollo's Rescue. You start playing with a little elephant, who has to rescue captive friends along the way. In other words, you start with a team of one character and end up with a large team.

make that one game where everything has a level and you can only defeat enemies with a lower level

Hi, sorry for pinging yall but I have a question: I'm making a game with the following idea: you're running the itch.io servers, and have to keep upgrading the servers to handle larger and larger traffic so that it doesn't crash during game jams, such as the GMTK Game Jam (all of the names will be modified of course). Is this idea acceptable, or is it considered too offensive to Mark Brown and the GMTK brand? If it is not acceptable I will change the theme to something else.

## Idea 1: Puzzle

You have several different characters of different sizes. The puzzle grid itself is subdivided lots of times (4?), creating "half-movements" for certain characters and such, creating openings only some of them fit through.

You basically get a Sokoban/sliding puzzle where pieces are _different sizes_, with some extra powers/special rules/spice.

(Maybe there are multiple pieces of one size; pressing their specific button/moving one will _move them all_, if possible.)

## Idea 2: Zoom-in Multiverse

There are multiple randomly generated universes layered on top of each other.

They all have different rules and different objectives. You win if you manage to be the majority presence ( = "conquer") all the dimensions (or the majority of the dimensions).

**Extension (might be its own idea):** Normally, you can only see the final actions or superficial stuff about the planet/enemy. But you can _zoom in_ to get more detail about their resources, their intentions => zooming in takes time and perhaps money, but it will give you a much better clue about how to strategize.
* This is probably best applied to a FIGHTER of some sort, like Slay the Spire. You can _scale_ all your enemies; making them bigger reveals more of their intentions and stats, but also makes them stronger/deal more damage of course.
* And then we can also modify OTHER properties => bigger things are heavier, bigger things have more HP, bigger things are easier to see, etcetera.
  * **Yes, sight is also a big one** => maybe a stealth game where being small obviously makes you harder to see, but also slower and less health.

**Something about dimensions**, where dimensions are very simply and consistently defined.
* Dimensions = SizeX, SizeY, PositionX, PositionY, but also "money" or "health" or "score" or "damage"
* Maybe you're just moving around in 2D space, but this necessarly means that most moves must change _two_ dimensions at the same time, requiring hard decisions.
* If we make this a 2D grid with something on all _four_ sides, and this can be changed by player, then POSITIONING YOURSELF becomes really strategic.
  * "If I move there, I have more health, but less damage."
* **And then you may also decide where the ENEMY stands, implementing that fighter idea from above.**

## Idea 3: Fill the space

You have a grid/randomized layout/world to fill up. It starts out (mostly) empty.

You can decide how LARGE you want everything you place to be. Larger = more effective/numbers multiplied. But obviously leaves fewer space for everything else later.

* Could use glueing things together / merging.
* Could use the "copying" idea of the market stalls from below.
* Could use the balancing of scales with everything you place.

## Idea 4: Micromanager Universe

It's about growing your empire and conquering the universe. But every single unit is bound to a different _key_. (And so are _locations_ or any other instructions you might want to give.) So as it grows, you'll really struggle to do the right things.

The main mechanic is then to be able to _group_ those units over time.

## Idea 5: Virus (Local Multiplayer)

You walk around a space (together with other players/bot healers). Your job is to progressively design a virus that will infect the most people/all people by the time the game ends. (Which is when all people have been either infected or definitely healed.)

(Probably works best on a grid, giving players X time to input their movement, then executing together.)

(Could also be spreading Religion/Cult instead of virus.)

## Idea 6: Robot Climbing Extreme (Local Multiplayer)

A front-view of a randomly generated rock climbing wall. (FRONT view, not side-view like all the other climbing games that people will probably make.)

Player(s) assemble their own little robot. Then they simply press GO and they all start climbing automatically. The one that gets the highest wins.

(This would mean the robot components are very simple fixed instructions: jump in current direction, rotate X degrees, float for Y seconds, etcetera. The wall itself should also help by having many "safe points", backups, automatic elements, etcetera.)

SIMILAR IDEA FROM DISCORD: I think I have a pretty good idea but im worried it wont work with the theme. I want to make a climbing game in two phases where you place hand holds on a mountain and then climb between them, so you are literally building to scale

## Idea 7: The perfect process

You must design some sort of process / robot / building / factory / whatever to devour/use/convert a randomly laid out puzzle. But you must do so PERFECTLY.

You can't leave anything behind, but you must also run out of energy/movement/space at the exact time you finish destroying the objective.


* You are made out of blocks (or just lego piece/smaller components) => they are your ammo and health, shooting more also makes you weaker and smaller
* You roll a ball (snowball?) and it simply glues itself to whatever it rolls _over_ along the way, which is how you can modify the properties, make the ball grow larger, etcetera, until you finally decide to throw it. => Perfect for local multiplayer, must really be 3D.
  * Inspired by "Katamari"
* SNAKE is the embodiment of this => your container stays the same, but you keep growing in scale.
* A seesaw? If you're bigger, you obviously shoot away anything on the other side with more force => not sure how this could become a game though.
* You create a path of obstacles. Enemies/Robots/Whatever will automatically scale down to whatever size is needed to push through gaps; use that to your advantage (as they must be a certain size, or they change properties or give bonuses depending on sizes)
* A game where containers (such as a bottle) are filled with stuff (such as pearls) => you must wiggle and weave to get them all _out_ of that container.
* By exiting/reentering rooms (or just discarding/reusing things), you make them bigger/smaller. These pieces are just tiles for the world, and you place them to extend the world as you go, to reach some finish line?
* A local multiplayer game where not moving/not doing an action means you grow BIGGER / SMALLER (whatever is the WORST thing) => like "Move or Die", but it's "Move or get Unpractically Small/Giant"
* Something about growing a business or scaling profits.
  * You make a tiny, really simplistic business/market stall/whatever.
  * When the day is over, though, how it worked and what you used/accomplished is _locked in_ => instead of single components, you can now place this ENTIRE STALL somewhere else.
  * So it's like one thing you built/assembled, and then you keep _copying_ it.
  * => You just started your Multi-Level-Marketing (MLM) Pyramid Scheme business and it needs to Scale ASAP. Grow it by getting more users below you in the pyramid, sell them your tons of stuff and make more money.
    * Could be related to that winning game from Game Off 2023, where you placed cards in a pyramid shape => but now you literally place users/victims underneath you in larger and larger rows.
* Something about modifying _graphs_ that determine how something will scale over time/in relation to some other factor.
  * Maybe you only get a few options and you must assign them to stuff.
  * Or you must _draw_ them yourself => **This could be combined with the robot climbing game, because drawing would allow you to really finetune when it jumps exactly, how far it rotates, etcetera.**
* The general idea of starting extremely minimalist (only 1 color, 1 key) => then growing to more complexity over time (more graphics, more mechanics, more controls)
* Something with glue/sticking things together to make them larger.
* A card game, but your cards go in differently sized slots (of predetermined size) that determine how their effect is used => could be combined with the "space filler"
* A puzzle game where the right move is the one that's up/down from your current scale. (And special situations allow you to _jump_ to a new root note/scale.)
* A local multiplayer game that constantly adds more and more players, asking you to call up other people to join (or try to do it all yourself)
* Something about comparing, balancing things on scales => maybe a game where the "dark side" and "light side" both have very useful actions, but you need to keep them balanced or you lose.
  * **This is so useful yet general, that it could be added to almost anything?**
  * Or maybe you do something once; then you must re-do it while achieving exactly the same score on the scale _towards the other end_. (Oh? You did "+5 Good" this run? Then you must do "+5 Bad" on the second one to win.)
* An infinitely upscaling kingdom builder or city builder (like that Hexagod I saw) => every time you only work on one section, then once you call it "done", it will keep doing what it does forever and you move to a new one.
* You _start_ with a randomly connected, huge, pretty non-functional factory. It's your job to actually break it down or repurpose it to do what you need => The alternative is building the factory yourself, but this feels harder to implement and more cliché?
* Feeding something to become bigger.
* Something more experimental about "scale is relative".
  * When you move, how far you move depends on what you're _next to_.
  * **This could be really powerful if I could find the simple mechanic to do it.** Otherwise, it is worthless philosophical meh.
* The idea from Giel: "Built to Scale" as if connecting two cities on a Ticket to Ride board.
  * This could be a general train network game, but that's a bit basic.
  * Perhaps "Built" and "Scale" are named after what they _do_.
    * In one area you can build and produce, nothing else.
    * In the other area you can only scale stuff you already received up/down. (And you can obviously produce the wrong stuff that you don't want scaled.)
* You modify the same shape all the time, with 4 "characters" at its edges. You can obviously only move one edge at a time (by activating that character), and perhaps "snap back". This way, you must constantly change size to grab certain powerups, but avoid obstacles or deaths.
* You start as a very tiny robot. This means you _can't do certain things_. You grow bigger / get more components over time, and that means you must GO BACK to earlier sections that you are now finally able to do.


More experimental stuff:
* A game that actually requires two games, and they access the same save data or something.
* A game with more and more _windows_ that somehow interact and are necessary
* A game with scaleable code, or moddability is the default => maybe it reads text files in the same directory and that's how you give all instructions?
* You have to scale the _levels_ instead of yourself, in some way.
