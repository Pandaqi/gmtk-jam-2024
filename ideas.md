* 5 PM-6 PM: Sunbluck update
* EVENING: after doing a few prototypes, pick the one we'll do for sure.



# Ideas for GMTK JAM 2024

**Theme = Built to Scale**

MOST PROMISING (have their own file):

* Business in a Bottle
* Bot Bouldering
* Built to Infect
* Stacked Multiverse
* Vanguardimensio


GOOD BUT WILL DO SOME OTHER TIME:
* Maybe a stealth game where being small obviously makes you harder to see, but also slower and less health.
* You are made out of blocks (or just lego piece/smaller components) => they are your ammo and health, shooting more also makes you weaker and smaller
* You roll a ball (snowball?) and it simply glues itself to whatever it rolls _over_ along the way, which is how you can modify the properties, make the ball grow larger, etcetera, until you finally decide to throw it. => Perfect for local multiplayer, must really be 3D.
  * Inspired by "Katamari"
* SNAKE is the embodiment of this => your container stays the same, but you keep growing in scale. => Which might lead to a game where you change the _boundaries_ of that world all the time, to change where apples spawn and give yourself more space when needed.
* You create a path of obstacles. Enemies/Robots/Whatever will automatically scale down to whatever size is needed to push through gaps; use that to your advantage (as they must be a certain size, or they change properties or give bonuses depending on sizes)
* A local multiplayer game where not moving/not doing an action means you grow BIGGER / SMALLER (whatever is the WORST thing) => like "Move or Die", but it's "Move or get Unpractically Small/Giant"
* The general idea of starting extremely minimalist (only 1 color, 1 key) => then growing to more complexity over time (more graphics, more mechanics, more controls)
* A puzzle game where the right move is the one that's up/down from your current MUSICAL scale. (And special situations allow you to _jump_ to a new root note/scale.)
* BALANCING SCALES: First you do a level/challenge once; then you must re-do it while achieving exactly the same score on the scale _towards the other end_. (Oh? You did "+5 Good" this run? Then you must do "+5 Bad" on the second one to win.)
* You modify the same shape all the time, with 4 "characters" at its edges. You can obviously only move one edge at a time (by activating that character), and perhaps "snap back". This way, you must constantly change size to grab certain powerups, but avoid obstacles or deaths. => Because that shape is flying through the area, scrolling the level, moving in some way.
* An infinitely upscaling kingdom builder or city builder (like that Hexagod I saw) => every time you only work on one section, then once you call it "done", it will keep doing what it does forever and you move to a new one.


MEH:
* A seesaw? If you're bigger, you obviously shoot away anything on the other side with more force => not sure how this could become a game though.
* A game where containers (such as a bottle) are filled with stuff (such as pearls) => you must wiggle and weave to get them all _out_ of that container.
* By exiting/reentering rooms (or just discarding/reusing things), you make them bigger/smaller. These pieces are just tiles for the world, and you place them to extend the world as you go, to reach some finish line?
* You _start_ with a randomly connected, huge, pretty non-functional factory. It's your job to actually break it down or repurpose it to do what you need => The alternative is building the factory yourself, but this feels harder to implement and more clichÃ©?
* Feeding something to become bigger.
* The idea from Giel: "Built to Scale" as if connecting two cities on a Ticket to Ride board.
  * This could be a general train network game, but that's a bit basic.
  * Perhaps "Built" and "Scale" are named after what they _do_.
    * In one area you can build and produce, nothing else.
    * In the other area you can only scale stuff you already received up/down. (And you can obviously produce the wrong stuff that you don't want scaled.)
* Something with glue/sticking things together to make them larger.
* You start as a very tiny robot. This means you _can't do certain things_. You grow bigger / get more components over time, and that means you must GO BACK to earlier sections that you are now finally able to do.
* You just started your Multi-Level-Marketing (MLM) Pyramid Scheme business and it needs to Scale ASAP. Grow it by getting more users below you in the pyramid, sell them your tons of stuff and make more money.
  * Could be related to that winning game from Game Off 2023, where you placed cards in a pyramid shape => but now you literally place users/victims underneath you in larger and larger rows.


SOME INTERESTING BITS FROM QUICK LOOK AT DISCORD:
* I have an idea that's free to anybody who wants to pick it up since I don't think I have the time or skills to finish it in time.  Dragons of vastly different sizes swim/fly around, you shoot them with arrows and their scales (haha, "scales") fall off, where the scales fall they become terrain features of different sizes (islands in the ocean or the like), then you need a system that makes it matter what the terrain ends up looking like.
* The idea of the jam reminds me of an old Sega game called Rollo's Rescue. You start playing with a little elephant, who has to rescue captive friends along the way. In other words, you start with a team of one character and end up with a large team.
* Make that one game where everything has a level and you can only defeat enemies with a lower level
* Hi, sorry for pinging yall but I have a question: I'm making a game with the following idea: you're running the itch.io servers, and have to keep upgrading the servers to handle larger and larger traffic so that it doesn't crash during game jams, such as the GMTK Game Jam (all of the names will be modified of course). Is this idea acceptable, or is it considered too offensive to Mark Brown and the GMTK brand? If it is not acceptable I will change the theme to something else.


MORE EXPERIMENTAL STUFF:
* Something about modifying _graphs_ that determine how something will scale over time/in relation to some other factor.
  * Maybe you only get a few options and you must assign them to stuff.
* Something more experimental about "scale is relative".
  * When you move, how far you move depends on what you're _next to_ or the _overall size of your area_ or something.
  * **This could be really powerful if I could find the simple mechanic to do it.** Otherwise, it is worthless philosophical meh.
* A game that actually requires two games, and they access the same save data or something.
* A game with more and more _windows_ that somehow interact and are necessary
* A game with scaleable code, or moddability is the default => maybe it reads text files in the same directory and that's how you give all instructions?
* You have to scale the _levels_ instead of yourself, in some way.
